[![Microsoft Fabric Reddit Community](https://img.shields.io/badge/Reddit-Microsoft%20Fabric%20Reddit%20Community-%23FF4500?logo=reddit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFabric/)

### Session Description

Join us for a focused, half-day technical lab where you'll experience Microsoft Fabric in actionâ€”end to end. Start in OneLake and explore how a single copy of data streamlines governance and eliminates duplication.

Through guided, role-based labs, you'll: 

- Create an architecture to enable a generative AI solution in Fabric 
- Ingest, transform, and enrich data using a variety of methods 
- Use Copilot to develop data solutions faster 
- Build a conversational Q&A system with Fabric data agents 
- Visualize data using Power BI 

Whether you're a data engineer, BI analyst, or data scientist, you'll leave having built a complete, governed data-to-insight workflowâ€”demonstrating how Microsoft Fabric unifies tools, teams, and innovation in a single afternoon

### ðŸ§  Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, learners will be able to:

- Understand the various options available for loading and storing data in a Microsoft Fabric analytics solution. 
- Perform basic data transformations using Spark and T-SQL. 
- Create, configure, and evaluate a Microsoft Fabric data agent.
