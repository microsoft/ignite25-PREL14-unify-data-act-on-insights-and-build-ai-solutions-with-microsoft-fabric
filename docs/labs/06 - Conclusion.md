Today you created an end-to-end analytics solution in Microsoft Fabric which included:

- Lakehouse 
- Spark notebook 
- Data warehouse 
- T-SQL notebook 
- Data agent 
- Semantic model 
- Power BI report 

## Next steps
This may be where our workshop ends today, but it is not the end of the analytics journey. Beyond what we covered is a world full of data integration, OneLake capabilities, security, data science with Spark, operational databases, and real-time intelligence use cases waiting to bring more value to your business. We would encourage you to check out the rest of what Microsoft Fabric has to offer!
