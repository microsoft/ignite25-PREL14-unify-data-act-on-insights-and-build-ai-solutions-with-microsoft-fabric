## Next steps
This may be where our workshop ends today, but it is not the end of the analytics journey. Beyond what we covered is a world full of data integration, OneLake capabilities, security, data science with Spark, operational databases, and real-time intelligence use cases waiting to bring more value to your business. We would encourage you to check out the rest of what Microsoft Fabric has to offer!
