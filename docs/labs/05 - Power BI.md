### 5.1 - Creating a semantic model

1. If necessary, return to the *@lab.CloudResourceTemplate(FabricPerUserPOCv3).Parameters[capacityName]* workspace created in *Lab 1 - Getting started* by selecting the **workspace icon** from the left navigation bar then selecting your workspace name from the flyout. 

    *Note: The icons on the navigation bar can be pinned and unpinned. Therefore, the icons you see may differ from the screenshot.*

1. On the **Choose tables from OneLake** page perform the following actions:

    - In the box with the text **Enter a semantic model name**, enter **Sales and Marketing**.
    - Check the box next to **dbo** to automatically select all the tables in the schema:
        - DimCustomer
        - DimDate
        - DimProduct
        - FactSales
    - Select **Confirm**.

1. From the **Home** tab of the ribbon, select **New measure** from the Calculations group.

    ![](../assets/images/05_new_measure.png)

1. In the formula bar enter the following DAX calculation then select **Commit** (the green check mark) to the left of the formuala (or press Enter on the keyboard):

    ```

    ```
    Total Sales Last Year = VAR LY = LASTNONBLANK(DimDate[CalendarYear], 1)-1
    Return  
    CALCULATE([Total Sales],

    )
    ```

## Next steps
In this lab you created a Direct Lake semantic model directly inside the Fabric UX. You added relationships to tables and created two calculations using DAX. Then you created a report on top of the semantic model using Copilot to develop quickly.
